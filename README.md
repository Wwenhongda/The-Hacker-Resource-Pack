 <p>My Instinct for finding a way around barriers and safeguards began very early. At about age one and a half, I found a way to climb out of my crib,
crawl to the child gate at the door, and figure out how to open it. For my mom, it was the first wake-up call for all that was to follow.
I grew up as an only child. After my dad left when I was three, my mother, Shelly, and I lived in nice, medium-priced apartments in safe areas of
the San Fernando Valley, just over the hill from the city of Los Angeles. My mom supported us with waitressing jobs in one or another of the many
delis strung out along Ventura Boulevard, which runs east—west for the length of the valley. My father lived out of state and, though he cared about
me, was for the most part only occasionally involved in my life growing up until he moved to Los Angeles when I was thirteen years old.
Mom and I moved so often I didn't have the same chance to make friends as other kids did. I spent my childhood largely involved in solitary,
mostly sedentary pursuits. When I was at school, the teachers told my mom that I was in the top 1 percentile in mathematics and spelling, years
ahead of my grade. But because I was hyperactive as a child, it was hard for me to sit still.
Mom had three husbands and several boyfriends when I was growing up. One abused me, another—who worked in law enforcement—
molested me. Unlike some other moms I've read about, she never turned a blind eye. From the moment she found out I was being mistreated—or
even spoken to in a rough way—the guy was out the door for good. Not that I'm looking for excuses, but I wonder if those abusive men had anything
to do with my growing up to a life of defying authority figures.
Summers were the best, especially if my mom was working a split shift and had time off in the middle of the day. I loved it when she'd take me
swimming at the amazing Santa Monica Beach. She'd lie on the sand, sunning and relaxing, watching me splashing in the waves, getting knocked
down and coming up laughing, practicing the swimming I had learned at a WCA camp that I went to for several summers (and always hated except
when they took us all to the beach).
I was good at sports as a kid, happy playing Little League, serious enough to enjoy spending spare time at the batting cage. But the passion
that set me on a life course began when I was ten. A neighbor who lived in the apartment across from us had a daughter about my age whom I
guess I developed a crush on, which she reciprocated by actually dancing naked in front of me. At that age, I was more interested in what her father
brought into my life: magic.
He was an accomplished magician whose card tricks, coin tricks, and larger effects fascinated me. But there was something else, something
more important: I saw how his audiences of one, three, or a roomful found delight in being deceived. Though this was never a conscious thought,
the notion that people enjoyed being taken in was a stunning revelation that influenced the course of my life.
A magic store just a short bike ride away became my spare-time hangout. Magic was my original doorway into the art of deceiving people.
Sometimes instead of riding my bike I'd hop on the bus. One day a couple of years later a bus driver named Bob Arkow noticed Iwas wearing
a T-shirt that said, "CBers Do It on the Air." He told me he'd just found a Motorola handheld that was a police radio. I thought maybe he could listen
in on the police frequencies, which would be very cool. It turned out he was pulling my leg about that, but Bob was an avid ham radio operator, and
his enthusiasm for the hobby sparked my interest. He showed me a way to make free telephone calls over the radio, through a service called an
"auto patch" provided by some of the hams. Free phone calls! That impressed me no end. I was hooked.
After several weeks of sitting in a nighttime classroom, I had learned enough about radio circuits and ham radio regulations to pass the written
exam, and mastered enough Morse code to meet that qualification as well. Soon the mailman brought an envelope from the Federal
Communications Commission with my ham radio license, something not many kids in their early teens have ever had. I felt a huge sense of
accomplishment.
Fooling people with magic was cool. But learning how the phone system worked was fascinating. I wanted to learn everything about how the
phone company worked. I wanted to master its inner workings. I had been getting very good grades all the way through elementary school and in
junior high, but around eighth or ninth grade I started cutting classes to hang out at Henry Radio, a ham radio store in West Los Angeles, reading
books for hours on radio theory. To me, it was as good as a visit to Disneyland. Ham radio also offered some opportunities for helping out in the
community. For a time I worked as a volunteer on occasional weekends to provide communications support for the local Red Cross chapter. One
summer I spent a week doing the same for the Special Olympics.
Riding the buses was for me a bit like being on holiday—taking in the sights of the city, even when they were familiar ones. This was Southern
Califomia, so the weather was almost always near perfect, except when the smog settled in—much worse in those times than today. The bus cost
twenty-five cents, plus ten cents for a transfer. On summer vacation when my mom was at work, I'd sometimes ride the bus all day. By the time I was
twelve, my mind was already running in devious channels. One day it occurred to me, If I could punch my om transfers, the bus rides nouldnt cost
anything.
My father and my uncles were all salesmen with the gift of gab. I guess I share the gene that gave me my ability from very early on to talk people
into doing things for me. I walked to the front of the bus and sat down in the closest seat to the driver. When he stopped at a light, I said, "I'm
working on a school project and I need to punch interesting shapes on pieces of cardboard. The punch you use on the transfers would be great for
me. Is there someplace I can buy one?"
I didn't think he'd believe it because it sounded so stupid. I guess the idea never crossed his mind that a kid my age might be manipulating him.
He told me the name of the store, and I called and found out they sold the punches for $15. When you were twelve, could you come up with a
reasonable excuse you might have given your mother about why you needed $15? I had no trouble. The very next day I was in the store buying a
punch. But that was only Step One. How was I going to get books of blank transfers?
Well, where did the buses get washed? I walked over to the nearby bus depot, spotted a big Dumpster in the area where the buses were
cleaned, pulled myself up, and looked in.</p>

<p>Jackpot!
I stuffed my pockets with partially used books of transfers—my first of what would be many, many acts of what came to be called "Dumpster-
diving."
My memory has always been way better than average and I managed to memorize the bus schedules for most of the San Femando Valley. I
started to roam by bus everywhere the bus system covered—Los Angeles County, Riverside County, San Bemardino County. I enjoyed seeing all
those different places, taking in the world around me.
In my travels, I made friends with a kid named Richard Williams, who was doing the same thing, but with two pretty major differences. For one thing,
his free-roaming travels were legal because, as the son of a bus driver, Richard rode for free. The second aspect that separated us (initially,
anyway) was our difference in weight: Richard was obese and wanted to stop at Jack in the Box for a Super Taco five or six times a day. Almost at
once I adopted his eating habits and began growing around the middle.
It wasn't long before a pigtailed blond girl on the school bus told me, "You're kinda cute, but you're fat. You oughta lose some weight."
Did I take her sharp but unquestionably constructive advice to heart? Nope.
Did I get into trouble for Dumpster-diving for those bus transfers and riding for free? Again, no. My mom thought it was clever, my dad thought it
showed initiative, and bus drivers who knew I was punching my own transfers thought it was a big laugh. It was as though everyone who knew what I
was up to was giving me attaboys.
In fact, I didn't need other people's praise for my misdeeds to lead me into more trouble. Who would have thought that a little shopping trip
could provide a lesson that would set my life on a new course... in an unfortunate direction?</p>



<p>VI.6th lal voe htat oy voe Mbittn vfzbqt nagye C poh aeovsn vojgav?
E
ven many Jewish families that aren't very religious want their sons to have a bar mitzvah, and I fell into that category. This includes standing up in
front of the congregation and reading a passage from the Torah scroll—in Hebrew. Of course, Hebrew uses a completely different alphabet, with VJ
, 2, and the like, so mastering the Torah portion can take months of study.
I was signed up at a Hebrew school in Sherman Oaks but got booted for goofing off. Mom found a cantor to teach me one-on-one, so I couldn't
get away with reading a technology book under the table. I managed to learn enough to get through the service and read my Torah passage aloud
to the congregation with no more than the usual amount of stumbling, and without embarrassing myself.
Afterward my parents chided me for mimicking the accent and gestures of the rabbi. But it was subconscious. I'd later learn that this is a very
effective technique because people are attracted to others who are like themselves. So at a very early age, all unaware, I was already practicing
what would come to be called "social engineering"—the casual or calculated manipulation of people to influence them to do things they would not
ordinarily do. And convincing them without raising the least hint of suspicion.
The typical shower of presents from relatives and from people who attended the reception after the bar mitzvah at the Odyssey Restaurant left
me with gifts that included a number of U.S. Treasury bonds that came to a surprisingly handsome sum.
I was an avid reader, with a particular focus that led me to a place called the Survival Bookstore in North Hollywood. It was small and in a seedy
neighborhood and was run by a middle-aged, friendly blond lady who said I could call her by her first name. The place was like finding a pirate's
treasure chest. My idols in those days were Bruce Lee, Houdini, and Jim Rockford, the cool private detective played by James Garner in The
Rockford Files, who could pick locks, manipulate people, and assume a false identity in a matter of moments. I wanted to be able to do all the neat
things Rockford could.
The Survival Bookstore carried books describing how to do all those nifty Rockford things, and lots more besides. Starting at age thirteen, I
spent many of my weekends there, all day long, studying one book after another—books like The Paper Trip by Barry Reid, on how to create a new
identity by using a birth certificate of someone who had passed away.
A book called The Big Brother Game, by Scott French, became my Bible because it was crammed with details on how to get hold of driving
records, property records, credit reports, banking information, unlisted numbers, and even how to get information from police departments. (Much
later, when French was writing a follow-up volume, he called to ask me if I would do a chapter on techniques for social-engineering the phone
companies. At the time, my coauthor and I were writing our second book, The Att of Intrusion, and I was too busy for French's project, though
amused by the coincidence, and flattered to be asked.)
That bookstore was crammed with "underground" books that taught you things you weren't supposed to know—very appealing to me since I
had always had this urge to take a bite of knowledge from the forbidden apple. I was soaking up the knowledge that would turn out to be invaluable
almost two decades later, when I was on the run.
The other item that interested me at the store besides their books was the lockpicking tools they offered for sale. I bought several different
kinds. Remember the old joke that goes, "How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, practice, practice"? That's what I did to master the art of
lockpicking, sometimes going down to the area of tenant storage lockers in the garage of our apartment building, where I'd pick open some of the
padlocks, swap them around, and lock them again. At the time I thought it was an amusing practical joke, though looking back, I'm sure it probably
threw some people into angry fits and put them to a good deal of trouble, plus the expense of a new lock after they had managed to get the old one
removed. Only funny, I guess, when you're a teenager.
One day when I was about fourteen, I was out with my uncle Mitchell, who was a bright star of my life in those years. We swung by the
Department of Motor Vehicles and found it packed with people. He left me to wait while he walked straight up to the counter—just like that, walking
past everyone standing in line. The DMV clerk, a lady with a bored expression, looked up in surprise. He didn't wait for her to finish what she was
doing with the man at the window but just started talking. He hadn't said more than a few words when the clerk nodded to him, signaled the other
man to step aside, and took care of whatever it was Uncle Mitchell wanted. My uncle had some special talent with people.
And I appeared to have it, too. It was my first conscious example of social engineering.
How did people see me at Monroe High School? My teachers would have said that I was always doing unexpected things. When the other kids
were fixing televisions in repair shop, I was following in Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak's footsteps and building a blue box that would allow me
to manipulate the phone network and even make free phone calls. I always brought my handheld ham radio to school and talked on it during lunch
and recess.
But one fellow student changed the course of my life. Steven Shalita was an arrogant guy who fancied himself as an undercover cop—his car
was covered with radio antennas. He liked to show off the tricks he could do with the telephone, and he could do some amazing things. He
demonstrated how he could have people call him without revealing his real phone number by using a phone company test circuit called a "loop-
around"; he would call in on one of the loop's phone numbers while the other person was calling the loop's second phone number. The two callers
would be magically connected. He could get the name and address assigned to any phone number, listed or not, by calling the phone company s
Customer Name and Address (CNA) Bureau. With a single call, he got my mom's unlisted phone number. Wow! He could get the phone number
and address of anyone, even a movie star with an unlisted number. It seemed like the folks at the phone company were just standing by to see what
they could do to help him.
I was fascinated, intrigued, and I instantly became his companion, eager to learn all those incredible tricks. But Steven was only interested in
showing me what he could do, not in telling me howall of this worked, how he was able to use his social-engineering skills on the people he was</p>
